This is actually the first research lab I joined in my undergraduate. Genuine thanks to Prof Roel Ophoff and Toni Boltz :) 

I mainly perform basic data processing and analysis tasks. I processed RNA sequence data and performed various data analysis and visualization methods on them using Python and R. 

I co-authored two papers during my research at the lab
- <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666247722000197?via%3Dihub">“Powerful eQTL
mapping through low-coverage RNA sequencing”</a>. We showed that Low-coverage RNA sequencing is an effective approach in Expression quantitative trait loci studies and can save the cost by more than 50%.
- <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.24.542156v1.abstract">“Cell type deconvolution of bulk blood RNA-Seq to reveal biological insights of neuropsychiatric disorders”</a>. We employ computational methods to deconvolute bulk RNA-Seq data from 1,730 blood samples, highlighting cell-specific genetic associations with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. By inferring cell type proportions and expressions, our approach offers a refined lens to discern previously masked trait-relevant mechanisms, underscoring the transformative potential of computational strategies in neuropsychiatric research.



Back in college, I dipped my toes into bioinformatics research for the first time. Those days were packed with awesome memories, loads of learning, and hands-on research experience. It felt amazing to see the stuff I'd learned come to life in something so meaningful.

After graduation I decided to step away from the bioinformatics lab since I thought that I need to focus more on my major stuff. So instead, I dived head-first into cool tech areas like reinforcement learning, computer vision, and multi-modal learning. But here's the twist: the deeper I got into these fields, the more I realized they have crazy potential in biology and medicine. 

So, here I am, thinking about how to merge these worlds together. I'm now looking into AI for Medicine/Bio Ph.D. programs, eager to bring all this tech goodness back to the world of medicine and biology. Exciting times ahead!
