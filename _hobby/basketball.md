I start playing basketball since 8! However, I encountered ACL injury at 2019, now I seldom play basketball, but rather watch the game (NBA and CBA).

I lack the sport ability when I was a child, especially, I seem to be "discordant" when playing sports. But due to my height (6'3 now), many suggests me to try basketball. So I "officially" started playing it since my second grade. 

When comes to junior middle school, our sports teacher always taught us martial art each and every time, and I did not have much time to play basketball.

In the high school, I picked up basketball again. I was not good at dribbling, but I did mastered in "Pivot". I played as the center, but sometimes I also played as small forward.
