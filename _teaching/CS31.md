Basic concepts in transport phenomena, including fluid dynamics (momentum transport) and heat transfer (energy transport), with applications to biological systems, both medical and non-medical.   
Topics in fluid dynamics include: properties of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids; dimensional analysis; drag; integral/macroscopic balances (Bernoulli's equation and linear momentum theorem); differential/microscopic balances (continuity and Navier-Stokes equations); boundary layer approximations; turbulence.   
Topics in heat transfer include elements of conduction and convection.
