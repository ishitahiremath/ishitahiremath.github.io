<h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">Dive Deeper into My World of Research Adventures</h2>
<p>Welcome! I’m Ishita Hiremath, exploring the frontiers of biology and technology. Here’s where I share my journey from foundational studies to ambitious innovations. Curious about how I blend bioengineering with real-world applications? Keep reading!</p>   

**Biomaterials**:      
From crafting scaffolds that aid in wound healing to investigating mucus as a potential hydrogel for skin applications, my enthusiasm for biomaterial research is profound. While I have yet to delve into this area, the notion of harnessing biomaterials for energy generation captivates me, making it a subject I consistently seek to understand further.
    
**Cellular and Molecular Biology**:    
Growing up, I was naturally drawn to biology, effortlessly excelling in my courses without the need for extensive preparation. What resonates with me the most is cell and molecular biology, particularly involving mammalian cells. I find cells to be extraordinary and beautiful — they are incredibly versatile and precise. My current project has provided hands-on experience with mammalian cell culturing and molecular biology, which I have thoroughly enjoyed. The intriguing concept of artificial cell creation continues to capture my imagination, further fueled by resources like [Talking to Cells](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOUDue_zQKg&ab_channel=caltech).  

**Computational Simulations**:  
Initially, coding was a formidable challenge for me, evoking significant anxiety during my undergraduate years. However, under [Prof. Wagner's](https://www.mcgill.ca/bbme/caroline-wagner) mentorship, I discovered coding's vast potential, transitioning from reluctance to proficiency. Today, I am not only comfortable with MATLAB but am also keen to explore other programming languages. My coding journey has been significantly shaped by [Tejas Vaidhya](https://tejasvaidhyadev.github.io/), whose encouragement was crucial in enhancing my digital presence via platforms like GitHub and fueling my ambition to apply computational solutions in new sectors. His guidance has enabled me to address complex challenges through programming, expanding my capabilities in this dynamic field. Motivated by these experiences, I am now eager to harness deep learning tools and models to seamlessly navigate and solve research challenges.
