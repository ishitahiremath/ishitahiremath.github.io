<h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">About me</h2>
Hello! I'm Chenda Duan, `a second-year MS student in Computer Science at UCLA`, advised by Prof. [Bolei Zhou](https://boleizhou.github.io/). I will be joining Prof. [Vwani Roychowdhury](https://www.vwaniroychowdhury.com/)'s group as a Ph.D student starting this fall. Previously, I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from UCLA as well! (So, 10 years at UCLA...)

üîç **Actively Seeking Opportunities**:
- **Summer Internship** as a Research Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, or Quant Researcher in the US.

If you believe there's a potential fit, please [contact me](mailto:chenda@ucla.edu). I'm eager to explore new challenges and collaborations.

<h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">About my academics.</h2>

The field of computer science is vast and ever-evolving. Within this expansive domain, it is hard to constrain yourself into a specific area of interest. I am a firm believer in the power of interdisciplinary research and the importance of a broad skillset. I am passionate about the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, LLMs, and robotics. I am also very interested in the application of machine learning in the field of Biology, Medicine, and Economics.

**Research Interests**:
- AI for Science
- LLM, LMMs
- Reinforcement Learning
- Robotics


At UCLA, I've been privileged to collaborate with three prominent research teams:

**Research Groups**:
- UCLA Prof Vwani Roychowdhury's Group
- UCLA Prof Bolei Zhou'S Group
- UCLA's Center for Neurobehavioral Genetics.
- UCLA Structures-Computer Interaction Lab.
