Bruinspace is an student club at UCLA. It features in different sub-group doing different projects. I was the software team-leader for <a href="https://bruinspace.com/projects/overseer">project Overseer</a>. 

Project Overseer aims to launch high-altitude to develop a reliable platform for scientific payload and technology demonstrations through the use of high altitude balloon launches.

When I took charge of project overseer software, we developed a program for monitoring and controlling the status of the balloon on Raspberry Pi and Xbee. Mainly, we need to process the location of the bloon, and predict it's future location. If the bloon is about to fly into forbidden zone, we need to cut it off.

I also provided Python tutorial sessions for the new club members
