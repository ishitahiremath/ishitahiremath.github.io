My current work on my master’s thesis is to unravel the interactions and binding dynamics between respiratory viruses 
and mucins. Doing so is critical as these interactions impact the mobility of pathogens across airway mucus barriers, with 
clear implications for host infection. This has entailed a synergistic approach that bridges theoretical modeling with 
experimental work.  
  
On the theoretical front, I have made substantial progress simulating the motion of tracer particles in viscoelastic 
environments with binding - a model system for virus motion in mucus. A significant aspect of my theoretical research has 
involved determining an appropriate theoretical framework for particle motion in non-Newtonian environments. Through 
collaborations with leading research groups in this area, I have developed a model that combines the statistics of Fractional
Brownian Motion (fBM) with various algorithms for binding and interaction. Additionally, I have developed an 
infrastructure to integrate other essential mucosal transport factors, such as local heterogeneity.  
  
Experimentally, I am the senior lab member in the group, and the steward of our primary piece of equipment, an 
inverted fluorescence microscope. Under Dr. Wagner's guidance, I have learned the technique of single particle tracking, 
and have applied this to characterizing and monitoring the transport of virus-like particles (VLPs) in mucin gels. Our VLP 
system is sourced from the laboratory of Prof. Hanrahan’s in the Department of Physiology at McGill University. To date, 
our VLPs have been developed with the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, IAV, RSV.  



Back in college, I dipped my toes into bioinformatics research for the first time. Those days were packed with awesome memories, loads of learning, and hands-on research experience. It felt amazing to see the stuff I'd learned come to life in something so meaningful.

After graduation I decided to step away from the bioinformatics lab since I thought that I need to focus more on my major stuff. So instead, I dived head-first into cool tech areas like reinforcement learning, computer vision, and multi-modal learning. But here's the twist: the deeper I got into these fields, the more I realized they have crazy potential in biology and medicine. 

So, here I am, thinking about how to merge these worlds together. I'm now looking into AI for Medicine/Bio Ph.D. programs, eager to bring all this tech goodness back to the world of medicine and biology. Exciting times ahead!
