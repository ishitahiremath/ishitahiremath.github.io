This is my final project for UCLA CS174A: Introduction to Computer Graphics

This is a simple game, which you try to score by throwing basketball. You can control the angle and throwing power. You can also preview the trajectory.

The game is seemingly trivial, but the key is to built graphic features. The game contains advanced graphic features, including shadow, texture, and reflections. We use only a lite version of WebGL called Tinygraphics, which contains basic geometry definition vector calculation functions. The rest majority features are built solely by ourselves.
