In China, especially since 2000, many parents want their children to master in at least one extracurricular activities. Most likely, they will choose for their children: piano, dance, drawing, go, violin became some of the most heated activitives among childrens, though clearly it is their parents who enjoy them more.

Likely, my parents asked me what I want to learn, instead of directly picked up one for me. I tried many things before I started learning double keyboard electone: drawing (I have to admit that I lack the "art cell" lol), go (aren't patient enough), piano(I simply thought there are too many people learning it, nothing unique there).

So, I start learning it, from the beginning single keyboard, then double keyboard. It took me days and nights to practice, to gain so-called "musicality". 

Back before, my ultimate goal was to pass the level 10 examination. But when I trully did it when I was 14, I felt like passing the exam should not be the goal, nor the end for playing music.

Since then, playing keyboard has become a way for relaxing, for exploring interesting songs, or simply for nothing but fun.
