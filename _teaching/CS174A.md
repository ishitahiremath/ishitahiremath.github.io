Fundamentals of non-Newtonian fluid mechanics and rheology as applied to biological fluids. 

Fundamentals of mass and momentum conservation, dimensional analysis, continuity equations, Generalized Newtonian Fluid models, and the solution of fluid flow problems using empirical constitutive relationships. 

Selected topics in polymer physics relevant to biological fluids. 

Fundamentals of rheological characterization, both macrorheology and microrheology. 

Application of these concepts to the rheology of selected biological fluids in health and disease, selected applications of biofluid rheology: drug delivery, biofluid / pathogeninteractions, and aerosol disease transmission.
