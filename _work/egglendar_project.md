title: Impact of Mucus Gels on Cellular Susceptibility to Respiratory Virus Infections

importance: 1

I have initiated preliminary studies for my PhD project focused on the impact of mucus gels on cellular susceptibility to 
respiratory virus infection. This has involved me learning the technique of cell culture in collaboration with the other labs in the Department. 
  
Additionally, I am in the process of developing a novel setup for culturing cells in a geometry that is compatible with both our imaging needs as well as the low-fluid volume requirements of our experiments using mucin gels. Currently, we are in the process of developing specialized lipid nanoparticles (LNPs, sourced from the laboratory of Prof. Chen in BME at McGill University) that contain instructions to produce a fluorescent protein upon cell infection. We aim to use this system to validate our cell infection setup, and study LNP uptake by cells with and without mucus barriers.
  
In the next project stage, we hope to use our platform to study infection using wildtype virus systems in collaboration with the laboratory of Prof. Grandvaux at the Université de Montréal.  
For my forthcoming PhD project, building on the current foundation, we plan to refine and characterize the 
advanced set-up. This will enable us to conduct in-depth host cell susceptibility and viral viability tests under a range of 
microenvironments, using climate-controlled chambers.  
  
This advancement sets the stage for multifaceted research including exploring mucin barriers' effects on host cell mechanics and susceptibility, assessing mucin's role in viral 
behavior, and evaluating antiviral therapy efficacy, among other areas
